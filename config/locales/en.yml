# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        body: On-site and digital access requests are managed by Aeon, an archives and special collections system. If you haven’t already created a Stanford Aeon special collections research account, you will need to do so as part of the request process. Once you have an Aeon account, you will be able to check the status of requests, edit or cancel requests, create a new appointment or edit an existing appointment, and review your request history.
