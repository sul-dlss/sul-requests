On <%= l @request.created_at, format: :short %>, <%= @request.user.to_email_string %> requested the following:

https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/<%= @request.item_id %>

However, there was a problem with the ILLiad API request:

<%= @request.data_to_email_s %>

You can view the status and details of the request here:

https://requests.stanford.edu/scans/<%= @request.id %>/status

Systems will try to improve the ILLiad request process, but in the meantime please create a transaction in ILLiad manually for:
ILLiad Username: <%= @request.user.sunetid %>
