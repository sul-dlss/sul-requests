      <p>Donald Ervin Knuth's work established the analysis of algorithms as an academic field. He contributed to the development of the rigorous analysis of the computational complexity of algorithms and systematized formal mathematical techniques for it. In the process he also popularized the asymptotic notation.</p>
      <p>In addition to fundamental contributions in several branches of theoretical computer science, Knuth is the creator of the TeX computer typesetting system, the related METAFONT font definition language and rendering system, and the Computer Modern family of typefaces.</p>
      <p>As a writer and scholar, Knuth created the WEB/CWEB computer programming systems designed to encourage and facilitate literate programming, and designed the MIX/MMIX instruction set architectures.</p>
      <p>Professor of computer science at Stanford University from 1968-1992, Knuth was born in January 10, 1938 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He received a B.S. from Case Institute of Technology in 1960 and a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1963. That same year he began to work on <title render="italic">The Art of Computer Programming</title>. He had initially accepted a commission to write a book on compilers which would later become the multi-volume <title render="italic">The Art of Computer Programming</title>. Originally planned to be a single book, and then planned as a six- and then seven-volume series. In 1968, he published the first volume.</p>
      <p>After producing the third volume of his series in 1976, he expressed such frustration with the nascent state of the then newly developed electronic publishing tools (especially those that provided input to phototypesetters) that he took time out to work on typesetting and created the TeX and METAFONT tools. At the TUG 2010 Conference, Knuth announced an XML-based successor to TeX, titled "iTeX",  which would support features such as arbitrarily scaled irrational units, 3D printing, animation, and stereographic sound.</p>
      <p>Knuth has won numerous awards for his work, including:</p>
      <p>First ACM Grace Murray Hopper Award, 1971
Turing Award, 1974
National Medal of Science, 1979
Franklin Medal, 1988
John von Neumann Medal, 1995
Harvey Prize from the Technion, 1995
Kyoto Prize, 1996
Katayanagi Prize, 2010
BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award, 2010
Stanford University School of Engineering Hero Award, 2011 </p>
      <p>He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1975. In 1992, he became an associate of the French Academy of Sciences. Also that year, he retired from regular research and teaching at Stanford University in order to finish <title render="italic">The Art of Computer Programming</title>. In 2003, he was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Society. Knuth was elected as a Fellow (first class of Fellows) of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in 2009 for his outstanding contributions to mathematics. He is also a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.</p>
      <p>On June 24, 1961 he married Nancy June Carter (b. July 15, 1939). They have two children: John Martin (b. July 21, 1965) and Jennifer Sierra (b. December 12, 1966).</p>

          <p>Hand-written notes on <title render="italic">The  Art of Computer Programming</title>, computer print-outs that were prepared for this book, various stages of the second edition of volume 2 of the book, 1980 revisions of the book, and the TeX form of the book. Also included is the correspondence received on the book, and correspondence between Knuth and his editor, Marion Howe.</p>
          <p><title render="italic">The  Art of Computer Programming</title> describes the body of scientific knowledge on the programming of digital computers. The second edition led to Dr. Knuth's development of METAFONT, his computer design typeface system allowing subtle changes in alphabet design, and his page-formatting system, TeX; both systems are intended for the creation of beautiful books by the hand of the original author/printer.</p>
          <p>Notes on the second edition of Volume 2, by Donald Knuth, July 30, 1980:</p>
          <p>I began to revise the first edition in November 1974, just after finishing revisions for the second printing of Volume 3. Worked steadily until October 1975, preparing hundreds of hand-written inserts. The intent was to preserve the existing page numbering. Marion Howe at Addison-Wesley unscrambled my manuscript using scissors, tape, etc. During 1976, Addison-Wesley found that the number of changes necessitated a complete resetting of the book. Cost of Monotype had skyrocketed; tried to match fonts on Linotron 505, no luck. I discussed the problem with Addison-Wesley chairman (Cummings) during a visit to Boston; decision was made to prepare new fonts for Linotron 505 by photographing the old ones. First results of this were awful; they tried to tune things up. Finally in the spring of 1977, I decided to work on typography myself, and I told them to stop trying as their method was not going to work. During the rest of 1977, I developed TeX and proto-METAFONT; was ready to compose Volume 2 in spring of 1978. I mostly worked on METAFONT and refinements to TeX during 1979, then returned to Volume 2 in 1980, when I made further technical revisions during April-June to incorporate the research results accumulated since 1975.</p>
          <p>I saved the following things for Archives: A. Original manuscript, as unscrambled by Marion Howe. B. Galley proofs from Universities Press, Belfast, showing why I got into typesetting. C. Galley proofs I made while recomposing the book in 1978. D. TeX form of Chapter 3 at the time I sent Addison-Wesley the first results of my work (June 1978). E. Marion Howe's comments on my initial try at Chapter 3. F. The state of the entire book as of the end of 1978: Chapter 3 revised, and Chapter 4 in its initial form. This copy also shows markings made by Marion Howe, and changes I made during 1980 (this was my source document for the final revision in 1980). G. The state of the entire book after 1980 revision but before proofreading by Aspvall and Liang, and before the final revision of the Computer Modern fonts. H. The state of the book just before final camera-ready copy made, showing last-minute refinements and the index. I. TeX form of the book as printed.</p>
          <p>Boxes 31-36: Subsequent editions of Volumes 1, 2 and 3</p>
          <p>Notes, by Donald Knuth, August 25, 1988</p>
          <p>From February 1995 to February 1998, my major project was to produce new editions of the existing volumes of The Art of Computer Programming: Volume 1 (3rd edition), Volume 2 (3rd edition), and Volume 3 (2nd edition). These were the first new editions of Volumes 1 and 3 since 1975, and the first new edition of Volume 2 since 1981. My work on typesetting, and other projects such as Concrete Mathematics, 3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated, and The Stanford GraphBase, had occupied nearly all of my time since 1977; now I could best return to The Art of Computer Programming by applying the typesetting software I had constructed to the main task that had motivated it from the beginning.</p>
          <p>The first major use of TeX had been to produce the second edition of Volume 2 in 1981. My secretary, Phyllis Winkler, then put the texts of Volumes 1 and 3 into the same form; but I never had had time to use the results of her work, because the international use of TeX had become so great that I knew I would have to completely revise that system. Thus in 1995 all I had "online" was a set of approximations to Volumes 1, 2, and 3, expressed in an old version of the TeX language that had become obsolete in 1982.</p>
          <p>I also had received many hundreds of letters from readers, and had made significant amendments to the text; I began to put those changes into electronic form, as a 350-page list of errata to the old editions. Silvio Levy volunteered to convert the old TeX files to modern TeX form, and to incorporate all of the new errata, while carefully proofreading everything; he began this work in 1996, while I was still gather the errata together.</p>
          <p>Finally in January of 1997, my errata lists were complete, and Silvio had also finished preparing the new electronic version of Volume 1. I began on January 11 to prepare the final version of that volume, and I had the first ten pages done on January 31.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile another volunteer, Jeffrey Oldham, had begun to convert all of the illustrations to electronic form in the METAPOST language – a major undertaking involving more than 600 illustrations, many of which were quite complex. While I was working on Volume 1, Levy and Oldham continued to prepare the text and illustrations for Volumes 2 and 3.</p>
          <p>I soon found that the existence of these documents in electronic form changed everything: The temptation to make small improvements (once prohibitively expensive but now easy) became irresistible. Therefore I soon found that I wanted to make dozens of improvements to every page. Fortunately the typographical tools now available made it possible for me to do this with reasonable speed, and I completed Volume 1 at 4am on April 21.</p>
          <p>Volume 2 was more of the same; I began it on April 29 and finished on September 3 (this time at 5:30 am). Work on Volume 3 began on September 16 – coincidentally the day my first grandchild was born! -- and consumed most of my energy until 4:30 am on February 27, 1998. The completed volumes totaled 670 +776 + 794 = 2240 pages.</p>
          <p>In these boxes I have placed the main things that seem to be worth archiving:</p>
          <p>0a. Xerox of the notebook entries I made while doing the work. 0b. Copies of email correspondence with Silvio Levy, 1995-1998. 1a. Volume 1 illustration proofs, showing the figures as received from Jeffrey Oldham. Handwritten corrections show most of the changes that I incorporated into the master files as I polished the book. 1b. Volume 1 first proofs: Pages formatted as received from Levy, with markings to show changes that I made while proofreading. (Most of the corrections are in green ink; red ink shows later changes made after the "green" ones were already corrected. This saved paper!) When I made extensive amendments, my first pencil drafts are often interfiled; but the drafts of shorter amendments were not saved. 1c. Volume 1 after I had completed one pass over the entire book. I laserprinted just this one copy and had it velo-bound, for use in preparing the index; then I circled items that needed to be indexed. 1d. Volume 1 index proofs: An inverted index of the old edition (used to cross-check that my new indexing hadn't forgotten anything), followed by the first proof of the new index. 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d. Same as above, but for Volume 2. 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d. Same as above, but for Volume 3.</p>

          <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
          <p>This set of 14 boxes contains materials from nine years of work on computer systems for publishing at stanford. 'The main results of this work have been published in five volumes entitled Computers &amp; Typesetting, Volumes A--E (Reading, Mass.: Addison Wesley, 1986).</p>
          <p>The research introduced three major computer systems: <list><item>1) TeX, a system for typesetting</item><item>2) METAFONT, a system for typeface design</item><item>3) Computer Modern, a family of typefaces</item></list> </p>
          <p>Another important byproduct was the WEB system for structured documentation of computer programs.</p>
          <p>Included are the original manuscripts, revised drafts, logbooks, commentary from other experts, research files, and correspondence pertaining to three major computer systems: TeX, a system for typesetting, METAFONT, a system for typeface design, and Computer Modern, a family of typefaces. Also included are keepsakes and specimens of early use of these systems.</p>
          <p>The manuscripts were written by Knuth as these systems were being created, together with intermediate versions and log books that show how things developed and changed over the years. Critical comments by leading experts, who helped to refine the ideas, are included. Many of the "first" editions printed by these new methods, at stanford and at many other places around the world, are also preserved here. The period 1977 - 1986 was one of dramatic change in the world of book publishing; numerous keepsakes and specimens from TeX and other systems have been collected.</p>

          <p>Archives from the development of Concrete Mathematics, a textbook by Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth and Oren Patashnik. 'This book, published in the surmner of 1988, is based on a Stanford course of the same name that I introduced in 1970 (and it has been taught ever since). It represents sort of a "manifesto" of the way I like to do mathematics, especially the mathematics associated with computer prograrrnning. After nearly twenty years teaching the course, I knew that it was time to put this textbook together and export the ideas to other universities. My goal was to produce the best exposition of mathematical manipulations since, say, cauchy's famous Cours de Mathematigue of the 1820's and 1830's. Ron Graham was a visiting professor who taught the Stanford course twice during my sabbatical leaves, both times with great success. Oren Patashnik was a graduate student in Computer Science who served as teaching assistant in the class several times, under both Graham and me.</p>
          <p>Drafts, proofs, and correspondence pertaining to the textbook by Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth and Oren Patashnik, which was based on a Stanford course taught by Knuth.</p>

            <p>Patashnik created a draft of the entire book, which was used by Stanford students for two or three years. During the last half of 1987 and the first half of 1988, I rewrote this draft and the result was used as a trial text at Stanford, Princeton, Brown, Columbia, Rice and CUNY. My handwritten manuscripts appear here, together with marked-up copies of Oren's draft, together with high-level notes I made to Graham letting him know the thrust of what I was doing so that he could provide maximum input. Correspondence and preprints of unpublished papers I consul ted during this time are also included.</p>
            <p>This part of the archive consists of ten legal-size folders. <list><item>1.0 Preface, Graffiti and permissions (see below)</item><item>1.1 Chapter One, Recurrent Problems</item><item>1.2 Chapter Two, Sums</item><item>1.3 Chapter Three, Integer Functions</item><item>1.4 Chapter Four, Number Theory</item><item>1.5 Chapter Five, Binomial Coefficients</item><item>1.6 Chapter Six, Special Numbers</item><item>1.7 Chapter Seven, Generating Functions</item><item>1.8 Chapter Eight, Discrete Probability</item><item>1.9 Chapter Nine, Asymptotics</item></list> </p>
            <p> Each folder has comments written on the outside that were notes to myself about what sources to read as I was writing the material. 'Ihese references are keyed to sixteen years worth of classnotes from the Stanford course; those classnotes are not part of the archive but they do exist in Stanford's Mathematical Sciences Library.</p>
            <p>Our book introduces a novel feature called "graffiti," borrowed from the non-mathematical brochure called Approaching Stanford. We asked stUdents to contribute their own cormnents so that we could print them in the margins of our book. These student contributions are included in folder I.O.</p>

            <p>Here are relevant letters from the production editor and book designer. These are of some interest because we wrote this book at a time when the process of book production is changing dramatically. Instead of sending a manuscript to the publisher and letting them carry the ball, this book was typeset by its authors. Still, we did not want to lose the professional services of a book designer, so we received advice on suitable format before we did the typesetting.</p>
            <p>Our book is interesting from another standpoint because it is the first book to be published with a new family of typefaces designed by Hermann Zapf, especially for mathematics, called AMS Euler. Part of my work on this book, was devoted to fine tuning of these fonts, so that they can be used in other mathematical publications. With the book designers help I was able to create a compatible text face (called Concrete Roman and Italic) to complement Zapf's mathematical characters.</p>

            <p>Another aspect of typesetting-by-author is shown here. We wanted the help of a professional copy editor as well as a book designer. In this case the copy editor could mark freely anything that needed to be double-checked, knowing that we would ignore all advice that we didn't like. The result, we think, is much better than in previous methods under which the copy editor would have supreme authority but would then be limited to making changes that would not upset the authors when page proofs appeared. This part of the archive also includes some correspondence I had with the copy editor.</p>

          <p>Material from the making of <title render="italic" type="simple">The Stanford GraphBase</title>, a book published by ACM Press and Addison-Wesley Publishing Company in 1993. It includes the notes I made to myself and to Stanford students during the 20-year period I was compiling material for that book. The book is based on a series of interesting computer programs and interesting data from which many experiments in computer science have been made; I expect many additional researches to be based on this system in the years to come, because experimental computer science is expanding rapidly. The book itself was named the Best New Book in Computer Science by the Association of American Publishers in 1994.</p>

          <p>This accession pertains to the lecture series on the general topic of faith and science delivered at MIT in the fall of 1999, which resulted in the book <title render="italic">Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About</title>. Included are correspondence, notes, transcripts of the taped lectures, drafts, and illustrations.</p>
          <p>"Materials from a unique episode in my life, when I was asked to give a series of six public lectures at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) on the general topic of faith and science. The lectures, delivered in the fall of 1999, were broadcast live on the Internet, and I'm told that tens of thousands of people watched them. Each 90-minute lecture consisted of a prepared talk followed by an impromptu question-and-answer session, with about 45 minutes devoted to each portion. Transcripts were made from the videotapes and I edited then during the summer of 2000, adding notes and references to the literature. They were published in 2001 by Stanford's Center for the Study of Linguistics and Information (CSLI), with the title "Things a Computer Scientist Rarely Talks About"--which was also the general title of the lectures when I gave them originally. A complete archive of that book appears here."</p>

            <p>The videotapes of all six lectures and the panel discussion were transcribed by staff members of Dr. Dobb's Journal, the company that did the webcasts. These transcriptions, though riddled with errors, provided a good basis fron which I could attempt to recreate the feeling of the original lectures (while watching the videotapes several times myself).</p>

            <p>One of the interesting tasks I faced was to convert videotape frames to illustrations that could be used in the book. The quality of video data is insufficient for large pictures, so I decided to render each image at the largest size that would retain reasonably sharp details. This limited me to slightly nore than 1 inch in each dimension, so it strongly affected the design of the book. The original pictures shown here in black and white were actually in color when viewed by computer, but color did not add anything important. Indeed, when I edited the pictures later, converting then to black and white, the lack of color made it possible for me to enhance nany details that would have looked strange if I had distorted the colors in a similar fashion.</p>
            <p>This folder contains: Original proofs of captured TV frames; An experinent with TV frames printed in color (fron the paael discussion); 0riginal proofs of the Poster illustration (scanned in parts); Original proofs of inages taken from 35mm slides; First proofs after conversion to black-and-white.</p>

            <head>Biographical/Historical note</head>
            <p>Background notes from Knuth:</p>
            <p>I began to collect material already in 1962, but began to work on Volume 4 in earnest in 1973, while visiting the University of Oslo on leave of absence from Stanford. For many years I made scribbled notes and continued to follow the literature as new techniques were discovered. However, I also took time out for other projects (notably typography) and other books (notably Concrete Mathematics and 3:16); then I spent a few years bringing Volumes 1--3 up to date in the 1990s. During 1999 I prepared "Volume 1 Fascicle 1", a paperback booklet about the MMIX computer; MMIX is a new computer intended for use in Volume 4 as well as in future editions of Volumes 1, 2, and 3. (All archives for that fascicle are included in the "MMIX archives" that were donated to Stanford in 2001, except that I recently found a few additional page proofs that I've included here.)</p>
            <p>I began to write the final copy of Volume 4A in the spring of 2001, in longhand as usual. My diary shows that I began to enter it into the computer on 22 July 2001: "happiness as I resume typing Volume 4 for the first time since 1977". (I had spent four months at the beginning of 1977 preparing what I thought would be Section 7.1; it was an 83-page typewritten manuscript, plus 22 pages of answers to exercises. About 100 copies were made and circulated at that time to interested computer scientists in various universities. The original of that MS is included below. Fate was, however, to intervene, because 1977 was the year that I realized I should drop everything else and work "temporarily" on typography. The TeX project began in the spring of that year and ran for roughly ten years.)</p>
            <p>In 2001 I actually began to work on Section 7.2.1.1, because I wasn't ready yet to write the opening parts of Chapter 7 (and Volume 4). I needed to flesh out the "middle" of the volume first, so that I'd have a better idea of what tone ought to be set in the opening pages. I continued with the next subsections, 7.2.1.2 through 7.2.1.7, which took several years because they cover a substantial amount of material. These drafts were first made available online as "prefascicles", beginning with prefascicle 2A --- which first went on the Web at 1am on 17 September 2001 [a few days after a somewhat more memorable event in the history of the USA]. Prefascicle 2B went online just before midnight on 31 December of that year.</p>
            <p>In 2002 I posted prefascicle 2C at noon on 13 June, and began to work on prefascicle 2d. Those two were however subsequently renamed 3A and 3B; prefascicle 3B went online on 14 February 2004. The prefascicles became true "fascicles", printed in paperback by Addison-Wesley, in 2005 when Volume 4 Fascicle 2 and (later) Volume 4 Fascicle 3 were ready.</p>
            <p>The same pattern was repeated as I continued to write: Prefascicles 4A and 4B went online in 2005, then Volume 4 Fascicle 4 was published in 2006. After finishing Section 7.2.1.7 I was ready to turn to the opening pages of the book; well, not quite: I began now with Section 7.1, still postponing the actual introductory pages. On 27 May 2005 I reread my draft of 7.1 from 1977 and made vague plans for reorganizing it substantially. By 30 May I had typed seven pages into the computer, and had accumulated a long list of things to look up in the library. (This was incidentally before Volume 4 Fascicle 3 was sent to the publisher in June of 2005.) I finished the first draft of Section 7.1.1 on 7 September 2005, and put it online as prefascicle 1B.</p>
            <p>However, I was soon to learn that Section 7.1.1 should be followed by hundreds of pages of new material, because Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3 were growing like crazy. Fascicle 2 had already been published, but at least two fascicles' worth of copy would be needed to precede it! So I decided to create a Fascicle 0, to precede Fascicle 1; and prefascicle 1B was renamed prefascicle 0B. I finished Section 7.1.2 (prefascicle 0C) on 17 March 2006. [Incidentally I had undergone surgery for prostate cancer at the end of 2005, and had radiation therapy during the spring of 2006.] By the end of 2006 I was ready to release Section 7.1.3, aka prefascicle 1A.</p>
            <p>I turned to the introductory material, prefascicle 0A, at the beginning of 2007, trying to be careful to make it "match" the end of Volume 3 without too much of a change in style even though the end of Volume 3 had been written some 35 years earlier. That prefascicle went public on 28 April 2007; Volume 4 Fascicle 0 was printed in paperback at the beginning of 2008.</p>
            <p>The remaining piece of the puzzle was Section 7.1.4, which turned out to be extremely interesting material for which I needed to do extensive research. I had typed two sample exercises destined for prefascicle 1B into my home computer on 30 June 2007, and had finished the first three pages by 2 July, thinking that the whole section would amount to roughly 30 pages max. In fact, Section 7.1.4 wound up 80 pages long, with 267 exercises(!), plus almost 60 pages more for answers to those exercises; and I didn't finish prefascicle 1B until 8 September 2008. Addison-Wesley published Volume 4 Fascicle 1 in 2009.</p>
            <p>The paperback fascicles went through several reprintings, and hundreds of readers sent comments. Much of this material had never before been published in book form, and in fact about a hundred of the exercises are original material that had never appeared before in any form. Therefore it was important to get extensive feedback from readers, and in this I was extremely fortunate. Finally at the end of 2010 I combined all the material from Fascicles 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Volume 4, added some appendices, and sent the completed manuscript to Addison-Wesley's production department (in the form of PostScript files) on 3 December 2010 --- curiously on the very same day that I submitted the final PostScript files for another just-completed book, Selected Papers on Fun and Games, to CSLI's production department at Stanford.</p>
