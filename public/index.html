	<a href="/admin/requestdefs"><h3>Request Definitions</h3></a>
	This part of the application defines various kinds of requests by library, current location, and other criteria. The required information is passed to 
	the request application from Socrates or SearchWorks.
	Each request definition can have its own text for
	request forms and its own selection of fields that will appear on the form.

    <a href="/admin/reqtests"><h3>Request Tests</h3></a>
	<p>
		A database of test records for request definitions.
	</p>
   	
	<a href="/admin/pickupkeys"><h3>Pickup Libraries</h3></a>
	Requests can be picked up at different sets of libraries, depending on various criteria. This part of the application provides keys 
	based on data in Symphony records, each of which can be associated with a set of pickup libraries to display on a 
	request form. The keys are based on various kinds of information found in Symphony records, such a substrings from certain Symphony location strings.
	<a href="/admin/messages"><h3>Messages</h3></a>
	Messages the user sees when there are system problems of some sort or error messages coming back from Symphony. Right now these message don't
	include validation errors for the form fields, for example, messsages that say a field value is missing or invalid.
